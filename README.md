### Custom Commands

Ability to add/remove custom text commands.

- `!cmd add test this is some text to be added.` Adds the command `test`.
- `!cmd remove test` Removes the command `test` with its subcommands.
- `!cmd add test !two this is test number two.` Adds the subcommand `test two`.

## Building

First check the project out locally. We use submodules so don't forget to initialize those.
```bash
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/qhris/DiabloSpeech.git
```
or
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/qhris/DiabloSpeech.git
$ cd ./DiabloSpeech
$ git submodule update --init
```

Next we can run and test the program on the different platforms.

### Windows
```powershell
$ ./build.ps1
```

### Linux / OSX / MSys
```sh
$ ./build.sh
```

Only Windows is currently officially supported, however the tests should still run.
